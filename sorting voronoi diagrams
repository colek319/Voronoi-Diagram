sorting voronoi diagrams

if you have 20 voronoi diagrams, how can we get one big voronoi diagram

if we have 60 convex hulls of each voronoidiagram

what are the weights of the diagrams

how ae they being sorted

what is being sorted

There are N lines in a voronoi diagram and K vertices

If we sort N lines by the amount of source flowing into them

	1-Forms
		+ One forms are the dual linear functionals of vector fields
			+ Theorem:
				Suppose we have a linear functional phi. 
				phi transforms 
				phi satisfies the following properties.
					- phi(v + w) = phi(v) + phi(w)
					- notice that this is just a morphism.
				v+w=x <=> phi(v + w) = phi(x) <=> phi(v) + phi(w) = phi(x) = v' + w' = x'
				What would happen if phi(v + w) != phi(v) + phi(w). The implications are the following
					++ Lets look at 1, 2, and 3
					++ Now evaluate each functional
						++ a morphism is a(1 + 2) = 3 = phi(1) + phi(2)
						++ If we insert values that into phi(1) and phi(2) 
							thare are not 1 and 2, then we get
								++ phi(1 + 2) = phi(3) = 2 + 3
								&&&&
								++ 1 + 2 = 3
								++ 2 + 3 = 5
								++ 1 + 2 + 2 = 3 = 5
								++ (1 + 1) + (2 + 1) = (3 + 1) = 4
								++ if a function sends 1 and 1 to 2 and the same function sends
